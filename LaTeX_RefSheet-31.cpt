\subsection{Suppress Floating with \texttt{float}}
For a thesis most students want to control the placing of figures and tables themselves.
One way is more control with \texttt{placeins}.
Another way is to avoid the environments figure and table using \lstinline+\captionof+.
Quick and dirty is an additional positioning parameter using \texttt{float}:\\
Load: \lstinline+\usepackage{float,scrhack}+\\
Use: \lstinline+\begin{figure}[H]+, \lstinline+\begin{table}[H]+
